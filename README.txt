An ATTO button for Simple Question filter
=========================================

Based on template from  Justin Hunt, the POODLL guy at  
https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-atto_newtemplate

Creates a button that inserts a text link, question number and display mode into 
Moodle editable text  with delimiter tags which will be picked up by moodle_filter_simplequestion.

Using this button (not available to students), teachers can select a question from the
current course question bank to be inserted.

Tested and working with Moodle 3.3 and 3.4.
